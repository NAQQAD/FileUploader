This is a website that helps you upload a photo and get a link to share it later with someone else. 
1)	First, you get to the home page and upload a file:

 <img src="https://github.com/Anatechi/FileUploader/blob/master/README/1.png">
 </p>
 
2)	Then, after checking the file extension, file size and correcting the file name, it saves it locally and provides a link.

 <img src="https://github.com/Anatechi/FileUploader/blob/master/README/2.png">
 </p>
 
-	This link is created with a simple hashing function to avoid bruteforcing the website.

3)	When this link is shared with someone else, he can retrieve it anytime before the expiration date:

</p>

Or else, the file gets deleted locally:
